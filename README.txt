# Password Hashing with Bcrypt

This Python script demonstrates how to securely hash passwords using bcrypt, a popular password hashing algorithm.

## Usage

1. Install Python (if not already installed) from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/).

2. Install the `bcrypt` library:

3. Clone the repository or download the `password_hashing_bcrypt.py` file.

4. Open the script and modify the `plaintext_password` variable to the desired password to hash.

5. Run the script:

The script will print the hashed password.

## Functionality

The `hash_password()` function securely hashes a plaintext password using bcrypt.

- `password (str)`: The plaintext password to hash.

The resulting hash is unique and irreversible, making it a secure representation of the password, suitable for storing in a database.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- [bcrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/) library
